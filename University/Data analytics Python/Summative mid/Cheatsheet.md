- data
	- Its distinct pieces of information usually formatted in a special way
		- Numbers
		- text
		- bits and bytes in memory
		- facts in someones mind

- What is data analytics
	- The process of examining large amounts of data to uncover hidden patterns, trends and insights
		- Descriptive analytics
			- This form answers the question of what happened and why, it gives insight into the past
			- Summarizes data into meaningful charts and reports
		- Predictive analytics
			- what is likely to happen
			- uses findings of descriptive analytics to detect clusters and exceptions, to predict future trends which makes it a valuable tool for forecasting
		- Prespcriptive analytics
			- Its to literally prescribe what action to take to eliminate a future problem or take full advantage of a promising trend




# Descriptive analytics focus

## Techniques

- One feature
	- Measures of frequency
		- Frequency
			- Number of times something appears
		- Relative frequency
			- ratio of times a thing appears, expressed in a percentage or decimal
		- Cumulative frequency
			- total number of times a value appears in data set
		- Cumulative Relative frequency
			- Refers to the ratio of times a value appears indataset and all values that come before it
		- Histograms
			- represents the distribution of continuous numerical data
		- Bar charts
			- Displays and compares different categories or groups frequency, count or relative frequency, best for categorical data
		- Pie charts
			- Few categories
	- Measures of central tendency
		- Mean
		- Mode
		- Median
	- Measures off dispersion
		- Range
		- Variance
		- Standard deviation
		- Interquartile range
		- Coefficient of variation
	- Measures of position
		- Decile
		- QUARTILE
		- Boxplot
		- Percentile
		- Z-score
	- Outlier detections
		- A score method
		- IQR method
		- Density plot
	- Contingency Table
		- Contingency tables , often called a cross-tab, are a way to organize and display data that shows the relationship between two categorical variables. Think of it as a special kind of table or grid that helps us see if there’s a connection or pattern between these variables.

	- Correlation heatmap
		- Correlation Heatmaps specifically visualizes the correlation coefficients between variables in a dataset. It shows relationships between numeric features.
	- Scatter plot
		- Scatter plots can help identify whether a relationship exists between variables. For example, a positive trend (upward slope) suggests that as one variable increases, the other also increases.
	- Line chart
		- Trend identification
		- Pattern recognition
		- Comparative analysis
