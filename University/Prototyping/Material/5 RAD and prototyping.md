## SDLC
- SDLC refer to a methodology with a clearly defined processes for creating high quality software and the lowest cost in the shortest time possible
- SDLC provides a well structured flow of phases that help an organization to quickly produce high quality sogtware which is well tested and ready for production use
- SDLC can eliminate redundant work and after the fact fixes



- SDLC Phases
	- Planning
	- Analysis
	- Design
	- Implementation
	- Testing & Integration
	- Maintenance
- SDLC uses
	- Early sample release of the product
	- Test functionality of the product
	- Feedback during design
	- Allow users to test product during the development process


### What is RAD? (rapid application development)

- Definition
	- It is a type of incremental model. In RAD model the components or functions are developed in parallel as if they were mini projects. The developments are time boxed, delivered and then assembled into a working project.
- RAD Characteristics
	- an adaptive software development model based on prototyping and quick feedback with less emphases on specific planning
	- The RAD model approach prioritizes development and building a prototype rather than planning. its based on prototypes
	- 



- Steps in RAD
	- Define requirements\
		- At the very beginning RAD sets itself apart
		- It doesn't require you to sit with end users and get a detailed list of specifications; instead , it asks for a broad requirement
		- The broad nature of the requirements helps you take the time to segment specific requirements at different points of the development cycle
	- Prototype
		- Where development takes place
		- Instead of following a rigid set of requirements, devs create prototypes with different features and functions ASAP.
		- More often than not these prototypes are quickly made to work to showcase just the key features
	- Construction
		- Crucial stage of development
		- Engineers and developers work tirelessly to flesh out a working system from a working model
		- This stage can be long, especially in cases where clients change directions or feedback is intensive
	- Deployment
		- Final stage, of RAD involves deploying the built system into a live production environment
		- The deployment phase involves intensive scale testing, technical documentation.
		- Teams also spend time debugging the app and running final updates and mainhtenance tasks before going live
- RAD Advantages
	- Requirements can be changed anytime
	- Reviews are quick and fast initial reviews occur
	- Cuts down on development time
	- The time between prototypes and iterations is short
	- Improves the reusability of components
- RAD Disadvantages
	- Needs strong team collaboration, large teams don't work
	- Needs highly skilled developers, more complex to  manage when compared to other models
	- On the high technical risk, its not suitable
	- Only systems which can be modularized can be developed using RAD
- When to use RAD
	- Tis the deadline for your project tight
	- When the technical risk is limited
	- Do you have the bugdet or the means to hire top-notch developer talent who can use the rad model effectively
