# Forms of prototyping

![[Pasted image 20240621120815.png]]


- High fidelity user prototypes
	- testing usability
- Live data prototypes
	- testing behaviour
- Low fidelity user prototypes
	- testing value proposition
- Feasibility prototypes
	- testing technical limitations





- Low fidelity
	- explores initial concepts and broad ideas
	- Essentially an interactive wireframe
	- Created by interactive designers to test the workflow
	- Simulates the process to identify usability issues early
	- Visual design
		- Only some of the visual attributes of the final product are presentated
	- Content
		- Only key elements of the cotnent are included
	- Interactivity
		- The prorotype can be simulate dby a real human
		- interactivity can also be created from wireframes, creating "connected wireframes"
- High fidelity
	- Realistic looking, working simulation
	- Good for communicating a proposed product to stakeholders
	- Used in defensive user testing, not to see if theyll like to but to learn if they wont
	- Similar to the real product
	- Visual
		- Reaslistic and detailed design
	- Content
		- Designers use real or similar to the real content
	- Interactivity
		- Prototypes are highly realistic in their interactions
- Feasibility prototype
	- For prototyping new technology
	- Engineer writes just enough code to see if its feasible
	- Code with minimal interface, usually intended to be throwaway code, its okay and normal to be quick and dirty with it
- Live-Data prototypes
	- The main purpose of a live data prototype is to collect tactual data so we can prove somethibg, or atleast gather some evidence. normally to find out if the idea really works. this means 2 things
		- First we need the prototype to access our live data sources
		- second. we need to be able to send live tracffic to get some useful data
	- Very limited implementation created by developers to actually prove it works
