1. Objective is to learn from our user
	1. Understanding the user is the first priority
2. Define what you want to test
	1. prototyping and testing is not something we do just once, its a continuous process
3. Set expectations
	1. prototyping is an experiment so set realistic expectations
4. We plan less and prototype more
	5. do not focus so much on planning what we are building, that is something discovered as we prototype
5. Start with low fidelity prototypes, iterate and then refine
	1. goes back to the 3rd principle but self explanatory
6. Draw!, learn to think with your hand
	1. Drawing helps visualize and realize our interests
7. We prototype just what we need
	1. There isn't always a need to include everything in your prototype.
	2. Prototype what's necessary and focus on that specific aspect
8. We do not fall in love with our first ideas
	1. Things can change, ideas change and priorities change too. 
9. Calm down! the first prototype is going to be rough
	1. It is almost impossible that at the first contact with our users our prototypes and solution concepts perfectly match what they are looking for and need. The prototype is going to be rough, so calm down. This is why little by little, we are going to rely on techniques to build our solution.
10. Keep track of what was learnt
