- General methodology of prototyping phases
	- Requirement gathering and analysis
		- Gathering and analysing the system requirement is a crucial step to behin the development of the prototype model
		- The system requirement gets defined and listed
		- During this process, the research team meets with end users to understand their expectation
		- Extensive market research and analysis helps in building the prototype model 
	- quick design
		- Using their research, developers make a preliminary design or a quick design
		- It is not the final design, but the only one that provides a brief idea of the system to any user
		- This design is instrumental in determining the fundamental elements of the prototyping model
	- Building a prototype
		- Developers use the quick design and the gathered research to create a prototype model
		- They develop a working model of the expected system, after building it developers present it to the stakeholders
	- Initial user evaluation
		- In this stage, the stakeholders including the client and the end users test the prototype model
		- They identify its strengths and weakness and provide feedback to the developers
		- The developers use this information to improve the prototype
	- Refining the prototype
		- Once the developers collect feedback, the implement the changes to improve the prototype
		- A developer may repeat this stage several times until the prototype model meets the requirements
		- At the end of this stage the final version is ready for production
	- Product implementation and maintenance
		- The product implementation and maintenance stage also known as the iterative development stage, is when the approved prototype is in the production phase
		- Developers go througn a process of design, coding and testing during production
		- After the testing and deployment, the soft3ware undergoes periodic maintenance to minimise downtime and prevent large scale failures



### Four methodologies of prototyping

- Rapid throwaway prototyping aka throwaway prototyping
	- allows developers to use the preliminary requirement and explore ideas to envision the final prototype
	- Constant customer feedback helps eliminate any design faults
	- the developed rapid throwaway prototype helps improve the quality of the prototype but often gets discarded
- Evolutionary prototyping
	- Its a functional piece of software not just a simulation
	- Its where the prototype requires an incremental refinement after every customer feedback
	- It helps save time, every iteration is a modified version of its predecessor
	- An evolutionary prototype helps when adopting  a new technology that requires trials
	- It is also beneficial when the requirements are not clear or when the functionality requires constant checking
		- TLDR; we know we dont undertand all the requirements, builds on those that are well understood and need constant checking and validation
- Incremental prototyping
	- Several individual parts make the final product
	- The design for each sectio happens separately before merging to create the final product
	- Helps reduce the time between user feedback and the implementation of the changes by the development team
	- Useful for enterprise software that has many moduls and componenets which maybe losely related to one another
- Extreme prototyping
	- Building an extreme prototype helps i nweb development, there are 3 phases to it
	- First phase
		- is a static prototype consists of html pages
	- Second phase
		- Fully functional using a simulated services layer
	- Third phase
		- The services are implemented


### Prototyping best practice

- You should use prototyping when the requirements are unclear
- It is is important to perform planned and controlled prototyping
- Regular meetings are vital to keep the project on time
