## Stages to final product

- Proof Of Concept
	- Questions to answer
		- Is my idea feasible?
	- a POC is a feasibility study in the project discovery phase before the development stage
		- Reasons
			- Verify the selected development approach
			- Check the feasibility of a complex technical solution
			- Define your solutions limitations
			- Evaluate what resources you need
			- Reduce the likelihood of failures during later development stages
- Prototype
	- Questions to answer
		- How will we build it
		- How will it look like?
	- Focus is on UI/UX
	- A prototype is an early product sample meant to demonstrate your business concept before implementing it
	- good for showcasing my products design
	- Can be 
		- Functional
		- Display
	- Reasons
		- Getting customer feedback without actual evelopment
- Minimum Viable Product
	- Main focus 
		- Basic functional version
	- Questions to answer
		- How do users respond to this 
		- Will the product be valuable
	- its a releasable version of my product that contains enough core features to attract early adopters
	- a good MVP helps you validate the market need without building  a comprehensive product
	- Main characteristics
		- Thrifty product
		- Core feature set
		- Value
		- Narrow target audience
	- Reasons to use an MVP
		- Starting your business with minimal resources
		- Securing venture capital or crowdsourced funds
		- Avoiding major product rejections
		- Building customer relationships
		- Creating better final products
- Final Product
	- Ready to be released to the market basically
	- It has gone through all the necessary stages of design, development and testing, has been refined to meet the needs and expectations of the target audience



TLDR;

- POC
	- Addresses the feasibility question
	- tests technical aspects
	- And reduces risk in furthere software development
	- Internal product and isnt the best option for showcasing
- A prototype
	- Lacks business logic of t he product but demonstrates its UI/UX or particular functionality
	- It can be shipped to a focus group for initial feedback and lets you discover the perceptions of the general concept and find gaps in the flow
- MVP
	- Is a functional product with primary features that best demonstrate the business concept. its not a full fledged product yet, but you can use it to collect user analytics and add or refine features in subsequent iterations
