# Definition of prototyping


- a first of preliminary iversion of a device or vehicle from which other forms are developed
- its an eearly sample of a product created to test a concept or process




## Prototype

- A prototype is a middle to high fidelity representation of the final product
- a prototpe is about the presentation of ideas
- can be as sophisticated or as crude as i want
- rarely mimics the whole system butstill can
- might evolve into final product or be replaced by an idea that worked better




## Prototyping fidelity

- the fidelity of a prototype refers to its level of completeness and detail


- High fidelity
	- much closer to the final product, very detailed andm uch more time-consuming
- Medium fidelity
	- slightly more detailed, still rough but closer to the solution
- Low fidelity
	- Low cost, rough and quick to build



# Wireframe vs mockup vs prototype

- Wireframe 
	- a wireframe is a blueprint or  a schematic that helps communicate the structure of your app or website to the relevant stakeholders
- Mockup
	- A mockup is a high fidelity render of my design that showcases how the finished product will look
- Prototype
	- a prototype is an early model of a product that focuses o functionality and gives your stakeholders a taste of the final version
- Wireframes communicate structure from a lowfidelity POV, mockups highlight a products design froma  hgh fidelity pov, prototypes focuses on the products functionality with the design






## Why prototyping

- prototypings essential to creating a successful software and successful user experient
- allows us to experiment in the safety of a form which acn be easily chnged without much loss of time or wasted effort when compared to re-programming software




## Characterstics of a prototype

- representation
	- a good representation of the actual product
	- representation is also representing to the way the product works
- precision
	- a good prototype should be highly precise
	- Should be accurate to everything
	- allows for better response and feedback
- functionality
	- should be highly functional
	- it should be able to achieve the purpose for which the product design was created 
- improvision
	- a good prototype canbe improvised with the least amount of effort
	- sometimes the designer do not account for all design elements when creating sketches for their ideas




## Prototyping stages

## Prototyping phases

- Ingeneral the process is partitioned into three classifications
	- Alpha
		- first iteration of prototypes and is priumarily concerned with answering two questionsd
			- Will the product work?
			- how will it look and feel
	- Beta
		- everything is becoming fully formed, the product is now fully functional and its pretty much visually preresentative
		- Seeks to refine and improve upon the product design, taking testing feedback etc.
		- this phase relies on two new versions
			- The engineering prototype and the production prototype
		- Pilot\
			- The final prototype is really the start of mass production and is called the pilot 



## Prototyping advantages & disadvantages

- Advantages
	- functionality
	- serve stakeholder
	- save time and money
	- collaboration among team
	- Provide user feedback
	- users can really feel the product
	- test the usability of the product to find problems
	- easy to communicate with users and leaders and other relevant people
- Disadvantages
	- incomplete analysis )accuracy issues)
	- user confusion
	- misunderstanding the end users
	- high focus on one part of the product
	- feasibility
	- too much effort may be invested in building prototypes
