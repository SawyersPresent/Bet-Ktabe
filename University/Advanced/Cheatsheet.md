**RESERACH IS EXPECTED FOR D QUESTIONS. SEARCH ON THE MAXIMUM, UNDERTSTAND EVERYTHING YOUR RIGHTING HE WILL ASK YOU ABOUT IT**


1. UML diagram is required, **do not apply solid principles**. it needs to meet the requirements of the project EXACTLY
	1. CRITERIA IS STRICTER ON US IT NEEDS TO BE CORRECT
	2. split it into stages
		1. Stage for files
		2. Stages for the list
		3. Stages for objects
	3. A good UML diagram should have the classes that are important organized in a rectangle for example
	4. All the process should be split up into rectangles to organize them
	5. Picture taken of the rectangle drawing talked about above
	6. tie the fathers together if their kids have a relationship to have there be less lines
		1. its a general relationship
		2. the subclasses also need to be explained
		3. if an object is not being used then have it be its own class
		4. fathers relationship if all the sons are involved (general), i can connect the two fathers rather than connecting all the subclasses to one another, the requirement is that the subclasses need to be connected to their own fathers
		5. There needs to be a table explaining the subclasses and their relationships
	7. Criteria is **P2**, you **CANNOT** LOSE THIS.
2. Refine your design by using design pattern to enhance the operation of your software and justify your choices
	1. name of the design pattern used, what are the classes involved in the involved design pattern
	2. justify why did you use the following design pattern and **WHY** THAT CLASS
	3. to be on the safe side, dont be happy with just 2 or 3 design principals, add more than 3. if you fuck up with one he can help you by looking at the other principles you have made
	7. THIS IS **M2** CRITERIA
3. Analyze how can the UML class diagram extracted from a given scenario, use the scenario above and your UML design as an example
	1. **D2** CRITERIA
	2. class diagram has 4 parts
		1. Classes
			1. Why each class has its attributes
			2. X attribute is here because its a key attribute in the DB
			3. "Encapsulation here is used to make things easier"
			4. "professor we did inheritence here because employee and student have shared attributes"
		2. relationships
			1. "this relationship between 1 and 2 is aggregation because X,Y,Z"
	3. Explain the primary classes, the attributes, the methods, the relationships with **WHY** and **HOW** you extracted them and **WHY** 
	4. Talk about access modifier for D
	5. There are types of classes with association reltaionship, some with aggregation some with composition and **WHY** I didnt use Aggregation or Association, have there be a distinction between the relationship, **why** is not a aggregation, **why** its not a association
	6. Interfaces
		1. Why use an interface here
		2. why use an abstract class why not a normal class whats the difference
	7. Extract meaning how did you get the following from the requirements
4. Examine the characteristics of Object Oriented Design and class relationships, provide examples of your project.
	1. this is **P1** YOU **CANNOT** MISS THIS CRITERIA
	2. General talk about object oriented
		1. Polymorphism, where you used it, what does it mean
		2. Encapsulation, where you used it, what does it mean
		3. Association, where you used it, what does it mean
		4. Inheritance, where you used it, what does it mean
		5. Interface, where you used it, what does it mean
		6. Abstract classes, where you used it, what does it mean
		7. aggregtation classes, where you used it, what does it mean
		8. talk about everything about OOP
5. Determine the design Pattern for each of Creational, Structural and Behavioral patterns types.
	1. M1 CRITERIA
	2. Explain them 
	3. Copy paste from the slides. to get easy criteria just list them i guess
6. Design Patterns have a positive impact on Object Oriented Design, Analyze the impact of Design Patterns on object oriented design listing advantages and strengths, support your findings with evidence and examples.
	1. **D1 CRITERIA**
	2. what are the advantages of Design Patterns on OOP.
		1. Flexibility
		2. Maintainability
			1. The tester after me can take care of it
		3. Extendibility
		4. Readability
		5. Any and ALL strengths
		6. Evidence from the project itself and explain it, outside of the project is okay too.
7. Use java programming language to Build the dataset processing application you designed in Task 1.
	1. **P3 Criteria**
	2. Implement UML class diagram in task 1, it has to be 100% ACCURATE IMPLEMENTATION TO THE UML
	3. If there are 10 classes in the UML then there are 10 classes in the code
8. Use java programming language to Build the dataset processing application you designed in Task 2.
	1. **M3 Criteria**
	2. Same thing but do it on task 2
	3. No report just implementation
9. Evaluate how the use of design pattern for enhancing application development of your code (provide evidence) from Task 8.
	1. **D3 CRITERIA**
	2. how did the design pattern benefit me in the coding, program
	3. Lets say I used the adapter, in this class, in this code. "if I had not used the adapter I would have had to re-copy paste the cody"
	4. Evaluate the choices you made interms of design patters, where they useful? did they benefit you?
	5. The student have to map the facts in the previous questions (task 2, task 8). To the design choices of his project the answer of this question is subject to student answer on (task 1 and 2) where he / she must justify the design choice ()
	6. Barer shu aw evaluate bel code (IN THE CODE) mokarane ma3 el UML diagram
10. When to use creational, structural and behavioral Design patterns, Provide an examples of.
	1. **P4 CRITERIA**
	2. Question 5 was just listing, do the same thing but instead of just listing it also add **when** to use the following. 
	3. this includes their designs, like facade, proxy, builder, singleton, prototype when to use it?
		1. For example, factory tell the professor when to use the factory
11. Choose a suitable design pattern for the following cases.
	1. **M4 CRITERIA**
	2. The constructor of a class have many parameters (6 or more) some of are mandatory the others are optional.
	3. An object is created and used in many different location in the system and may be created by many different developers
	4. Represent a large object that should be loaded on demand and avoids duplication of the same object.
	5. in shopping site: the user adds items to the basket and by the end on checkout, the user can choose the payment method in runtime: PayPal, Credit Card and so on.
12. In the previous question (Task 11) justify your choice of Design pattern
	1. **D4 CRITERIA**
	2. Justify why / when to use it
