- Creational design pattern
- separate the construction of a complex object from its representation so that the same construction process can create different representations
- it is used to construct a complex object step by step and the final step will return the object
- Dont forget to string
- there needs to be 3 classes
	- Product class (what gets created)
	- Builder class
	- Class that uses the builder
