- can be used when a class needs a method from another class but the data type is different
- an example;
	- customer
		- **INTERFACE**
		- Getname
		- Get address
	- Employee
		- Fullname
		- Office location
	- BusinessCard
	- EmployeeClassAdapter
		- Extends employee implements customer
	- main
	- in this example
		- the address for the customer is `address` while for the employee is `officelocation` so we create an adapter class that turns the `OfficeLocation` into an `address` for it to be used in the main
