GO IN WITH **MINDFULNESS**, BE AWARE OF **EVERYTHING** AND READ **EVERYTHING**

```
im in SOC for a big bank in europe. slowly im realizing how fucking incompetent everyone (me included) is. we like to jerk off our dicks, do advanced (very overpriced) training/certifications, but if an APT or a single patient, a bit more skilled dude tried, he would get through the defenses. literally all we know how to do, or even can do, is run defender scans on endpoints and isolate a device. only several hours later would we find out that the attacker has spread to other devices we also have to isolate. by the time we get to that he can be everywhere.  
if defender stopped working or had some error, noone in my team would be able to do anything but watch.

> Keep watch on network transmissions as this is how hackers will move through, and learn how to look for rootkits in your machines.  
> Defense in depth is essential.
