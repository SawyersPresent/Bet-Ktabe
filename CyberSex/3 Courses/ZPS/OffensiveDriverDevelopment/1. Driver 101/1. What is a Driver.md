A driver's most typical use case is to allow an operating system to talk to a hardware device.  Most of the drivers you will have running on your computer facilitate communications between the OS and your computer hardware (motherboard, hard drives, graphics cards, etc).  Often when we buy new hardware, we're also required to install software from the manufacturer.  That software often includes a driver, which allows your computer to talk to said hardware.

For this reason, a driver operates in kernel mode.

A driver doesn't need to control hardware, and pure software drivers do also exist.  The purpose of those will vary - one example of such a driver is anti-virus, where the driver is designed to help protect the computer against malicious actions.
