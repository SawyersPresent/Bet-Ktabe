`DbgPrint` (debug print) can be used to send messages to the kernel debugger, which is handy for printing informational statements.  For instance, we can add the following to our DriverEntry:

```
DbgPrint("[+] Hello from FirstDriver DriverEntry\n");
```



DbgPrint can take additional parameters, which we can display with format strings.  For instance, if we wanted to display an error code, we could do:

```
if (!NT_SUCCESS(status))
{
    DbgPrint("[!] Failed with status 0x%08X\n", status);
}
```



You will also see **KdPrint**, which is a macro for DbgPrint.
