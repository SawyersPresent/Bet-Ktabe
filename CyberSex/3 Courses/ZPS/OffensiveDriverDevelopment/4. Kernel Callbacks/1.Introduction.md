Kernel callbacks provide a way for drivers to receive a notification when certain events occur.  The more relevant ones from an attack/defence perspective are:

- ProcessNotify - called when a process is created or exits.  Useful for preventing the process from starting outright, or to inject a userland DLL (that can perform tasks such as API hooking) before control of the process is returned to the caller.
- ThreadNotify - called when a new thread is created or deleted.  Useful for detecting/preventing some process injection techniques by looking for threads being created from one process to another.
- LoadImageNotify - called when a new DLL is mapped into memory.  Useful for detecting/preventing suspicious image loads, such as the CLR being loaded into a native process, or modules synonymous with tools such as Mimikatz.

These are used rather extensively by AV, EDR and system monitoring applications - [Sysmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon) being a notable example.
