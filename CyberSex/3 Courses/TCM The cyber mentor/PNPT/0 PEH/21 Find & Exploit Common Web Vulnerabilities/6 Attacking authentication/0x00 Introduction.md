Look for authentication flow!, the difference between authentication and authorization is like the following

- Authentication
	- Your identity its who you are
	- For authentication is showing your ID or your Passport when checking into the hotel
- Authorization
	- What your allowed to do
	- It is what your allowed to do
- Methods of attacking authentication
	- Brute forcing
	- Logic flaws
