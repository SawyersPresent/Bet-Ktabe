## General course / lab philosophy (important, keep repeating this)

- Labs should **not** and honestly **must not** be delegated to random third-party websites  
- Especially not:
	  - “Upload APK to get report” sites  
	  - automated sandboxes that hide all internals  
- If ANY external service is used:
	  - students must already have **equal or higher technical understanding**
	  - otherwise they are just clicking buttons
- Malware RE is about:
	  - understanding *how* things work
	  - not memorizing steps
- Students need:
	  - full local control
	  - the ability to break things
	  - the ability to mess up emulators and recover via snapshots
