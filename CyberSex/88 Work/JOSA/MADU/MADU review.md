lab 1:
- labs should not and **never** be delegated to another website or service.
- and if it is there needs to be knowledge that is on par with the technical skills that are being taught which is not present 
- there should be a VM which is provided by JOSA to students for them to have a safe container to execute malware and analyze it.
- everything taught in the lab can be taught in the course directly.
	- Example: Create a JOSA vm which contains all of the malware analysis tool they would need to complete the labs, create a folder which contains benign malware which does not achieve anything and just launches calc.exe, this can be achieved using msfvenom.
	- then have each of the malware represent a lab. for example lab1.exe is for the first name for the first virus and attach a youtube walkthrough
