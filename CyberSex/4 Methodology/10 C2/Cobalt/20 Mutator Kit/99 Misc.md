LLVM doesnt obfuscate inline-assembly so it rapes everything else


sleepmask kit (decrypts beaccon) is built in with BeaconGate (new UDRL)


write a program that loads a DLL from memory, from a webserver. takes 1 argument the second argument is the function to call, just do this in a remote dll instead (like messagebox), make it so that the functions that are needed can be found dynamically, use a python hotpatch to fuck with the stub (UDRL, a stub is needed inline assembly is needed once the stub is added the sRDI becomes a UDRL)
