### Summary

The `[mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html)` module uses a rule-based rewriting engine, based on a PCRE regular-expression parser, to rewrite requested URLs on the fly. By default, `[mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html)` maps a URL to a filesystem path. However, it can also be used to redirect one URL to another URL, or to invoke an internal proxy fetch.

`[mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html)` provides a flexible and powerful way to manipulate URLs using an unlimited number of rules. Each rule can have an unlimited number of attached rule conditions, to allow you to rewrite URL based on server variables, environment variables, HTTP headers, or time stamps.

`[mod_rewrite](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/mod/mod_rewrite.html)` operates on the full URL path, including the path-info section. A rewrite rule can be invoked in `httpd.conf` or in `.htaccess`. The path generated by a rewrite rule can include a query string, or can lead to internal sub-processing, external request redirection, or internal proxy throughput.

Further details, discussion, and examples, are provided in the [detailed mod_rewrite documentation](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/rewrite/).
