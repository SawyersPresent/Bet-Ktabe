- didnt research much because i was too lazy to re-do all my progress lol
- cracked the hash correctly but almost ran out of patience
- didnt use common sense when reading the pannel infront of me and got mega confused
- privesc was kernal exploit so  i guess i should have tried that
- used hints and only used the writeups at the admin login pannel where i got stuck
