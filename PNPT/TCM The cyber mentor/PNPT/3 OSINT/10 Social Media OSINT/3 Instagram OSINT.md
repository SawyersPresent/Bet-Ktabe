- Pictures say a thousand words
- Look through pictures and see different things
- Look at their following
	- Look at people who have the last name?
	- Same first name?
- Look up Instagram handle in google with other things


Go to any profile page and view page source and look for `profilePage_`, what this means is no matter what the person changes their handle to, that ID will ALWAYS stick to them and find them no matter what, its something you need to have initially

If you are on insta and you wanna save the photo but you cant what you can do is use a tool called https://imginn.com which allows u to save images, so reverse image searching becomes possible and easier
