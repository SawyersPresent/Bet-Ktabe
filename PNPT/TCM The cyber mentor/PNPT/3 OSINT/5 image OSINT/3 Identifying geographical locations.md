`The affection of many Europeans for America’s unloved old land barges has been a frequent subject on this site.  Enthusiasts in Germany, Sweden and other countries will go to considerable effort and expense to own American full size cars of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s that get little collector interest in their home country, where German cars took over during that era.  So it is quite appropriate to find this 1994 Cadillac Fleetwood in Gothenburg, Sweden, parked away from the historic [German Church](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/German_Church,_Gothenburg) on the other side of the canal that surrounds the old city.  The owner of this chrome-laden, vinyl-topped cruiser with a Rolls Royce grille clearly does not worship at the church of German cars.`
