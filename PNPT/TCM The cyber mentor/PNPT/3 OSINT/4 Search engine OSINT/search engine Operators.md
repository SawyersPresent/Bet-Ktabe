dont be afraid to search passwords

yo uacn use `AND` as an operator. dont forget `site:` also exists

an exampel would

`C958 AND "PROFESSOR LEONARD" site:reddit.com`


what did they call him? they called him something mentor. here we can use the wildcard

`"heath adams" the * mentor`


looking for password stuff
`site:tesla.com password`, mayeb this wont work so lets try smth else
`sitetesla.com password filetype:xlsx`



if you wanna find subdomains what you could do is this
`site:tesla.com -www -forums`

this removes the www option and the forums option, we could also look for passwords


`"heath adams" intext:password site:twitter.com`
`"heath adams" intitle:password site:twitter.com`
`"heath adams" inurl:password site:twitter.com`
you could also check the URL if a password is there but text usually works
