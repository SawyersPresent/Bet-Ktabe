- we have an account, now what?
	- Search for quick wins
		- Kerbroasting
		- secrets dump
		- pass the hash / pass the password
	- No quick wins? dig deep
		- enumerate w/ Bloodhound
		- where do these accounts have access to?
		- old vulnerabilities die hard
			- Eternal-Blue etc.
- Think outside the box
