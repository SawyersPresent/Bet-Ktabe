- reflected 
	- comes from the current HTTP request, only shows me local stuff unless its in the URI and then sent to someone
- Stored
	- the payload is stored into the database and then is retrieved later
- DOM-Based
	- The client side has vulnerable JavaScript that uses untrusted input rather than having the vulnerability be serverside


`print()`
`prompt(hello)`

`function logKey(event{console.log(event.key)}`
`document.addEventListener('keydown', logKey)`
