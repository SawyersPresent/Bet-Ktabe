### Policies

A policy is a set of predefined configuration options in the context of a Nessus scan.

When we save a policy, we can use it as a template for a new scan.

The 3 general vulnerability scanning templates:

- **Basic Network Scan** - Performs a full scan with the majority of settings predefined. It will detect a broad variety of vulnerabilities and is therefore the recommended scanning template by Nessus. We also have the option to customize these settings and recommendations.
- **Advanced Scan** - A template without any predefined settings. We can use this when we want to fully customize our vulnerability scan or if we have specific needs.
- **Advanced Dynamic Scan** - comes without any predefined settings or recommendations. The biggest difference between the two templates is that in the Advanced Dynamic Scan, we don't need to select plugins manually. The template allows us to configure a dynamic plugin filter instead.

**Note:** Nessus plugins are programs written in Nessus Attack Scripting Language (NASL) that contain the information and the algorithm to detect vulnerabilities. Each plugin is assigned to a plugin family, which covers different use cases.
