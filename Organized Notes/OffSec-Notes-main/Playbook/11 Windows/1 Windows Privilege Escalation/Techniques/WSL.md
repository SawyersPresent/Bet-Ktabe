Look inside of the directory, the full path usually looks like this

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Packages\CanonicalGroupLimited.UbuntuonWindows_79rhkp1fndgsc\LocalState\rootfs\
```

usually its somewhere there if its not then look here in this folder and look for anything that starts with `CanonicalGroupLimited`

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Local\Packages
```
